(AP pic)HANOI: The mopeds are back in Hanoi, cars once more clog Karachi’s streets and gridlock has returned to Beijing’s ring roads – as lockdowns caused by the coronavirus ease, the temporary respite from traffic has also been broken.Asia’s megacities are notoriously traffic-choked, inflicting dizzying pollution and enervating daily delays on their residents.Yet for a few weeks pedestrians ruled the roads as lockdowns, curfews and self-isolation prodded by fears over the Covid-19 pandemic did the once unthinkable and kept hundreds of millions of people indoors.For a while, the entrance to Yangon’s golden Sule pagoda emerged from behind the swirl of buses and banged-up cars.Bangkok’s air quality momentarily turned “clean” as the vehicles squeezing along its main thoroughfares vanished, while in Beijing overpasses were emptied after China banned movement as it grappled with the spread of the virus.But restrictions have eased in most of Asia’s seething cities as nations tamp down the first wave of the virus and economies heavily reliant on the movement of people – and famed for a vibrant street life – grind back into gear.Mopeds again fill every available space between the cars around Hanoi’s Hoan Kiem lake, a buzzing menace to people trying to cross the road.In Hong Kong, revellers are slowly returning to the streets of Lan Kwai Fong, a popular drinking area in the central business district that went quiet during a temporary ban on the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants.Karachi once more teems with rickshaws and buses while normal business has resumed at the cross-harbour bridge in Sydney.And in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province, where the virus emerged last year, vehicles once again clog the city’s highways and roads as life returns to normal.Subscribe to our newsletter and get news delivered to your mailbox.TAGSlockdownpandemictrafficVietnamvirusPrevious articleRace to prevent coronavirus ‘nightmare’ in Rohingya campsNext articleIndividu bujang dilarang rentas negeri jumpa keluargaAFPRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOREU told to stop being naive, pay more to fight China disinformationCourt rejects appeal on ending Ligue 1 season, suspends relegationsAirlines heading for US$84 bil loss this year, says IATAMOST VIEWED LAST 2 DAYSIt’s positive, say PH leaders after rare meeting attended by Dr M, AnwarJune 9, 2020 6:56 PMNajib posts photos, queries Guan Eng over tycoon’s accountsJune 9, 2020 12:06 AMMusa Aman freed of corruption, money laundering chargesJune 9, 2020 10:24 AMOpen the borders earlier than Aug 31, says tourism groupJune 8, 2020 8:30 AMAG tells why charges against Musa ‘untenable’June 9, 2020 7:24 PMDon’t charge RM10 for RM3.80 items, hairdressers toldJune 7, 2020 11:51 PMHealth ministry reports record number of daily recoveriesJune 9, 2020 5:45 PMPAS lodges MACC report against Guan Eng, Tommy Thomas over tycoon’s bank accountsJune 9, 2020 12:17 PMDr M, 5 others file suit to nullify PPBM membership terminationJune 9, 2020 4:40 PMKids might not care anymore, parents say as school break goes onJune 8, 2020 1:18 PMFMT GALLERYPhotosThe grave matter of earning a livingJune 5, 2020 12:05 PMPhotosOld Town’s EMCO bluesMay 14, 2020 7:43 AMPhotosRamadan dusk at a workers’ kongsiMay 11, 2020 11:47 AMCURRENT HIGHLIGHTSAnwar slams Muhyiddin’s ‘deafening silence’, insists on return to Dewan RakyatJune 9, 2020 11:34 PMHeed plight of differently abled students, says Suhakam commissionerJune 9, 2020 11:16 PMEx-union leader wins RM210,000 for unfair dismissal.June 9, 2020 10:10 PMMAHB ready for take-off under RMCO, says CEOJune 9, 2020 9:42 PMGovt to continue using hydroxychloroquine on Covid-19 patientsJune 9, 2020 9:23 PMMOST VIEWED LAST 2 DAYSIt’s positive, say PH leaders after rare meeting attended by Dr...June 9, 2020 6:56 PMNajib posts photos, queries Guan Eng over tycoon’s accountsJune 9, 2020 12:06 AMMusa Aman freed of corruption, money laundering chargesJune 9, 2020 10:24 AMCURRENT HIGHLIGHTSAnwar slams Muhyiddin’s ‘deafening silence’, insists on return to Dewan RakyatJune 9, 2020 11:34 PMHeed plight of differently abled students, says Suhakam commissionerJune 9, 2020 11:16 PMEx-union leader wins RM210,000 for unfair dismissal.June 9, 2020 10:10 PMAbout UsContact UsAdvertise With UsJobs at FMTDAILY NEWS DIGESTLeave this field empty if you're human:Disclaimers / CopyrightPrivacy & PolicyCopyright © 2020 FMT Media Sdn Bhd.
