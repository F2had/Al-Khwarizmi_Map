(AP pic)HANOI: The mopeds are back in Hanoi, cars once more clog Karachi’s streets and gridlock has returned to Beijing’s ring roads – as lockdowns caused by the coronavirus ease, the temporary respite from traffic has also been broken.Asia’s megacities are notoriously traffic-choked, inflicting dizzying pollution and enervating daily delays on their residents.Yet for a few weeks pedestrians ruled the roads as lockdowns, curfews and self-isolation prodded by fears over the Covid-19 pandemic did the once unthinkable and kept hundreds of millions of people indoors.For a while, the entrance to Yangon’s golden Sule pagoda emerged from behind the swirl of buses and banged-up cars.Bangkok’s air quality momentarily turned “clean” as the vehicles squeezing along its main thoroughfares vanished, while in Beijing overpasses were emptied after China banned movement as it grappled with the spread of the virus.But restrictions have eased in most of Asia’s seething cities as nations tamp down the first wave of the virus and economies heavily reliant on the movement of people – and famed for a vibrant street life – grind back into gear.Mopeds again fill every available space between the cars around Hanoi’s Hoan Kiem lake, a buzzing menace to people trying to cross the road.In Hong Kong, revellers are slowly returning to the streets of Lan Kwai Fong, a popular drinking area in the central business district that went quiet during a temporary ban on the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants.Karachi once more teems with rickshaws and buses while normal business has resumed at the cross-harbour bridge in Sydney.And in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province, where the virus emerged last year, vehicles once again clog the city’s highways and roads as life returns to normal.Subscribe to our newsletter and get news delivered to your mailbox.TAGSlockdownpandemictrafficVietnamvirusPrevious articleRace to prevent coronavirus ‘nightmare’ in Rohingya campsNext articleIndividu bujang dilarang rentas negeri jumpa keluargaAFPRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORCoronavirus cases worldwide surpass 9 millionIndia sees record number of virus cases, over 400 deaths in 24 hoursSaudi Arabia completely lifts lockdown after 3 monthsMOST VIEWED LAST 2 DAYSDAP, Amanah pledge black and white deal for power transition after 6 monthsJune 22, 2020 11:52 AMAnwar tells of distrust about naming Dr M as PMJune 22, 2020 12:11 AMMusic maestro Ooi’s family suffers another blowJune 21, 2020 7:45 AMGirl who drove against traffic fined RM18,000, jailed 5 yearsJune 22, 2020 12:25 PMNo guarantee Dr M won’t switch sides to ‘traitors’, says PKR manJune 22, 2020 10:42 AM3 months’ free electricity for those with bills of RM77 and belowJune 20, 2020 12:18 PMAnwar perjelas sebab tidak setuju Mahathir jadi PM kali ke-3June 21, 2020 11:58 PMUmno man questions timing of suit against Musa, claims smear campaignJune 21, 2020 12:44 PMCheck the minutes, DAP and Amanah tell PKR treasurerJune 20, 2020 8:40 PMSPECIAL FEATURESViveka wins ATC scholarship and says it's all for dadS Viveka is one of the recipients of the ATC Cares 2020 Scholarship specifically targeted to those from the B40 community.FMT GALLERYPhotosOld school, new habitsJune 10, 2020 10:15 AMPhotosThe grave matter of earning a livingJune 5, 2020 12:05 PMPhotosOld Town’s EMCO bluesMay 14, 2020 7:43 AMCURRENT HIGHLIGHTSCoronavirus cases worldwide surpass 9 millionJune 22, 2020 11:59 PMSabah elephants died of poisoning, says wildlife officialJune 22, 2020 11:16 PMKindergartens not ready, postpone reopening, says unionJune 22, 2020 10:46 PMStumped over missing key content from OCM websiteJune 22, 2020 10:44 PMUmno Youth calls for royal commission to probe Tabung HajiJune 22, 2020 10:03 PMMOST VIEWED LAST 2 DAYSDAP, Amanah pledge black and white deal for power transition after...June 22, 2020 11:52 AMAnwar tells of distrust about naming Dr M as PMJune 22, 2020 12:11 AMMusic maestro Ooi’s family suffers another blowJune 21, 2020 7:45 AMCURRENT HIGHLIGHTSCoronavirus cases worldwide surpass 9 millionJune 22, 2020 11:59 PMSabah elephants died of poisoning, says wildlife officialJune 22, 2020 11:16 PMKindergartens not ready, postpone reopening, says unionJune 22, 2020 10:46 PMAbout UsContact UsAdvertise With UsJobs at FMTDAILY NEWS DIGESTLeave this field empty if you're human:Disclaimers / CopyrightPrivacy & PolicyCopyright © 2020 FMT Media Sdn Bhd.
